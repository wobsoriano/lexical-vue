features:
  - title: Reliable
    details: Lexical is comprised of editor instances that each attach to a single content editable element. A set of editor states represent the current and pending states of the editor at any given time.
  - title: Accessible
    details: Lexical is designed for everyone. It follows best practices established in WCAG and is compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
  - title: Fast
    details: Lexical is minimal. It doesn't directly concern itself with UI components, toolbars or rich-text features and markdown. The logic for these features can be included via a plugin interface.
